## Testing


### Bugs
* One of the trickiest problem i found was around alignment during the project, in particular when it came to responsive design. My mentor pushed me in the direction of flex-box which although i don't think was covered in the course made things alot easier. In my research Bootstrap seemed to come up quite often and one of the course alumni told me that on his version of the course this was covered off before the first milestone project so i look forward to learning more about that.
* Form Security. On the contact us page i introduced a very simplistic from but as highlighted earlier this is a non secure form. I did look to see if there was a way I could make it secure but again look likes technology i've yet to cover off .php? In addition it would be useful to add ReCaptcha to the form to prevent hackers bombarding the site with requests.
* In general i found myself googling quite a lot to help resolves issues that I encountered along the way which i could not resolve by reviewing the relevant modules. Alongside reaching out to my peers on SLACK. Some of the key sites that I used were:
    * [w3schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * [StackOverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * [FreeCodeCamp] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/)
    * [CSSTricks] (https://css-tricks.com/)


### Future Releases
* Obviously the ability to shop directly from the site is imperative so a full ecommerce checkout would be top of the list.
* Product Slideshows. Again product photography is king to sell the product to the customer. I did look into slideshows etc but it appeared that the majority of solutions required Javascript which I have not yet covered off in the course.
* HP Slideshow - As above to show off more brand content to keep the customers interest
* Instagram Feed - To help keey site content fresh
* Live Chat - Another useful feature to help customers convert.
